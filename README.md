INSTRUCTIONS

Please create a small application that will convert numbers from 1 to 100,000 into words. It will need to include all punctuation and conjunctions.

The application will need to allow the user to input a range (start and end). If no range is provided, it should output the entire range above (1 to 100,000,000 in words).

Example use case:
The user enters a start "1000" and an end of "2222".
The application will then output that range in words. For example:
One thousand
One thousand and one
One thousand and two
… etc. … etc.
Two thousand, two hundred and twenty two


APPROACH

- TDD the app using Node js and Jasmine testing suite.

- Start with input from 1-19. Work up to larger units once this works.


Instructions

- Clone this repo

- Make sure you have Node and npm installed

- Run tests with:  npm test

- Run app with:  node index.js

- Change the parameters for 'new Numbers' on line 4 of index.js


Have only been able to implement the app for numbers 1 - 19 in the alloted time. Would really liked to have had more time to get further. Fun though!
